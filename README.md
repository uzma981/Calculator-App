# Calculator-App

üëâüèªCalculator in C# Windows Form Application using Visual Studio 2019

üî¶Why i decided to build a calculator?
- Calculators are a simple yet effective tool that everyone uses on a daily basis to help solve basic numerical problems. 
- A physical calculator is just as popular as a computer based calculator, therefore i wanted to create an application that mirrored the original calculators that live in our OS! 
- Initially started off with a simple calculator, later enhanced the application to a scientific calculator which includes alot more buttons than the 4 basic arithmetic operations. 


üî¶About the calculator -
- A fully functional calculator using the Windows Form application in Visual Studio (C#).
- The application will help users perform basic tasks such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. 
- The users are also able to perform Pi, logarithmic, trigonometry and square root functions.
- The trigonometry problems involve: sine, cosine, tangent and their inverses. 

üî¶Math Class in C# used in the project -
- Math.Pi- represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, specified by the constant, PI(œÄ).
- Math.Cos(), Math.Sin(), Math.Tan(),Math.Cosh(), Math.Sinh(), Math.Tanh().
- Math.Pow() Returns a specified number raised to the specified power.
-Math.Sqrt() Returns the square root of the specified number.
-Math.Log() Returns the logarithm of a specified number. 
-Math.Log10() Returns the base 10 logarithms of a specified number. 

Even better ifs:
- Improvement on the visual design of the calculator
- Enhance the app into a graphical calculator
